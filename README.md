Small script to toggle Variable Refresh Rate on Windows 11

Normally, you must follow the path Settings>System>Display>Graphics>Advanced graphics settings, and then toggle the "Variable refresh rate" setting on or off.

This script modifies the registry to change the setting without navigating any menus. All of it is done in the background, and you get a message displaying whether the setting is now on or off.

Runs with powershell or powershell 7 by defualt.
